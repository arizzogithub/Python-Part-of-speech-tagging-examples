Task:
1. Evaluate the tagger as it is against the tagged sentences in NLTKâ€™s sample treebank corpus and report your result.
2. Improve the accuracy of the tagger as much as you can by coding REs for parts of speech that are not covered in the book version, particularly closed-class words such as prepositions and conjunctions, and report your results.
